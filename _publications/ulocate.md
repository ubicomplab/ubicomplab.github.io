abstract: |-
  Researchers have developed different kinds of location technologies for observing daily activities. However, there are very few systems that are able to ubiquitously monitor an individual's location, especially for people aging with disabilities. In this study, we developed a location tracking system, uLocate, capable of both indoor and outdoor tracking. The system was evaluated in real homes by 11 participants aging with different types of disabilities. Based on our evaluations, we believe uLocate and the findings of this case study will benefit designers and rehabilitation researchers who require location-based tracking technologies for health-related studies.
