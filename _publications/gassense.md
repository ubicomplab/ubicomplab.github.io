  This paper presents GasSense, a low-cost, single-point sensing solution for automatically identifying gas use down to its source (e.g., water heater, furnace, fireplace). This work adds a complementary sensing solution to the growing body of work in infrastructure-mediated sensing. GasSense analyzes the acoustic response of a home's government mandated gas regulator, which provides the unique capability of sensing both the individual appliance at which gas is currently being consumed as well as an estimate of the amount of gas flow. Our approach provides a number of appealing features including the ability to be easily and safely installed without the need of a professional. We deployed our solution in nine different homes and initial results show that GasSense has an average accuracy of 95.2% in identifying individual appliance usage.
