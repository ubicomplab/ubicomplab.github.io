  Time of use tiered pricing schedules encourage shifting electricity demand from peak to off-peak hours. Charging times for electric vehicles (EV) can be shifted into overnight hours, which are usually off-peak. EVs can also be used as energy storage devices, available during certain peak hours to power a house with electricity stored during off-peak hours. Studies suggest both techniques are practical, but were based on simulated demand patterns or large commercial fleets. To investigate feasibility on a per home basis, we collected data from 15 EV homes using the Lab of Things sensing infrastructure. We evaluate a scheme that powers homes with their car battery during expensive electricity periods and then charges the battery during cheaper periods. We show an average potential savings of $10.91/month for shifting charging times, and an additional $13.58/month for powering the home from the EV, even accounting for the inefficiencies of electric conversion.
