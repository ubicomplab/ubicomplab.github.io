abstract: "Power remains a challenge in the widespread deployment of long-lived wireless\
  \ sensing systems, which has led researchers to consider power harvesting as a potential\
  \ solution. In this paper, we present a thermal power harvester that utilizes naturally\
  \ changing ambient temperature in the environment as the power source. In contrast\
  \ to traditional thermoelectric power harvesters, our approach does not require\
  \ a spatial temperature gradient; instead it relies on temperature fluctuations\
  \ over time, enabling it to be used freestanding in any environment in which temperature\
  \ changes throughout the day. By mechanically coupling linear motion harvesters\
  \ with a temperature sensitive bellows, we show the capability of harvesting up\
  \ to 21 mJ of energy per cycle of temperature variation within the range 5 \xB0\
  C to 25 \xB0C. We also demonstrate the ability to power a sensor node, transmit\
  \ sensor data wirelessly, and update a bistable E-ink display after as little as\
  \ a 0.25 \xB0C ambient temperature change."
