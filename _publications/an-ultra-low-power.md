abstract: "Wearable sensor systems have been used in the ubiquitous computing community\
  \ and elsewhere for applications such as activity and gesture recognition, health\
  \ and wellness monitoring, and elder care. Although the power consumption of accelerometers\
  \ has already been highly optimized, this work introduces a novel sensing approach\
  \ which lowers the power requirement for motion sensing by orders of magnitude.\
  \ We present an ultra-low-power method for passively sensing body motion using static\
  \ electric fields by measuring the voltage at any single location on the body. We\
  \ present the feasibility of using this sensing approach to infer the amount and\
  \ type of body motion anywhere on the body and demonstrate an ultra-low-power motion\
  \ detector used to wake up more power-hungry sensors. The sensing hardware consumes\
  \ only 3.3 \u03BCW, and wake-up detection is done using an additional 3.3 \u03BC\
  W (6.6 \u03BCW total)."
