abstract: "A persistent concern of wireless sensors is the power consumption required\
  \ for communication, which presents a significant adoption hurdle for practical\
  \ ubiquitous computing applications. This work explores the use of the home powerline\
  \ as a large distributed antenna capable of receiving signals from ultra-low-power\
  \ wireless sensor nodes and thus allowing nodes to be detected at ranges that are\
  \ otherwise impractical with traditional over-the-air reception. We present the\
  \ design and implementation of small ultra-low-power 27 MHz sensor nodes that transmit\
  \ their data by coupling over the powerline to a single receiver attached to the\
  \ powerline in the home. We demonstrate the ability of our general purpose wireless\
  \ sensor nodes to provide whole-home coverage while consuming less than 1 mW of\
  \ power when transmitting (65 \xBCW consumed in our custom CMOS transmitter). This\
  \ is the lowest power transmitter to date compared to those found in traditional\
  \ whole-home wireless systems."
