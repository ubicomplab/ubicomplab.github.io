## PhD Students
We receive a lot of inquiries from prospective PhD students wanting to join the lab, but unfortunately we are not able to take every student. We are also not able to directly admit to the lab and students must apply and be admitted to the UW CSE or EE PhD program before we are able to make commitments to students. Students interested in joining the lab as a PhD student should contact Prof. Shwetak Patel.

## Masters Students
We certainly welcome Masters students, but prioritize funding and RAs to PhD students. From time to time we may offer an RA to Masters students. However, we typically first ask Masters students to work on a small project in the lab for course credit to establish fit and confirm the studentâ€™s interest in the topic area. 

## Undergraduates
Undergraduate research is an important part of the lab and we have a very active group of undergraduates working in the group. 

## Applying
Undergraduates and Masters students interested in conducting research in the Ubicomp lab must fill out an application before the start of the quarter during the academic year. We use the applications to keep track of everyone interested in doing research and to find project matches. Please note that we often get many more applications than positions we have, but we will try our best to find an opportunity for you.

<a href="https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/6137820/UbiComp-Lab-Research-Application-Spring-2021">Apply Here</a> to get involved in the Winter quarter. Application due March 29th, 2021.


## High school research opportunities 
The Ubicomp Lab invites a select number of high school students from the Seattle area to conduct an intense 8-week long research project during the summer.  Prof. Shwetak Patel created this program because of his own participation in research when he was in high school and the incredible experience it provided for his career path. Applications for the Summer 2021 program are now open. The deadline for the application is May 1st, 2021, and decisions will be made by June 1st, 2021.
