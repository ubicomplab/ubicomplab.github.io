## Local Development

1. Install Ruby if not already installed (installed by default on OS X). On Windows, use http://rubyinstaller.org/. On Linux, run `sudo apt-get install ruby-full`. This should come with the gem package manager.
2. Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop. `gem install github-pages` This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.
3. Clone down your fork `git clone git@github.com:ubicomplab/ubicomplab.github.io.git`
4. Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes `jekyll serve`
5. View your website at http://127.0.0.1:4000/
6. Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch of your GitHub user repository. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve your website.
